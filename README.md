# Starlink Tracking Dashboard
This is a React.js-based visualization dashboard that allows users to track satellites in real-time based on geo-locations. The dashboard includes built-in selectors to refine satellite search by location, altitude, and duration. The core tracking functionality is achieved by fetching nearby satellites' info and position prediction data through the N2YO APIs and React-Simple-Map to animate selected satellite paths on a map.

## Features
- Real-time tracking of satellites
